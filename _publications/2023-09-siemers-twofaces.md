  Artificial intelligence is bringing ever new functionalities to the realm of mobile devices that are now considered essential (e.g., camera and voice assistants, recommender systems). Yet, operating artificial intelligence takes up a substantial amount of energy. However, artificial intelligence is also being used to enable more energy-efficient solutions for mobile systems. Hence, artificial intelligence has two faces in that regard, it is both a key enabler of desired (efficient) mobile functionalities and a major power draw on these devices, playing a part in both the solution and the problem. In this paper, we present a review of the literature of the past decade on the usage of artificial intelligence within the realm of green mobile computing. From the analysis of 34 papers, we highlight the emerging patterns and map the field into 13 main topics that are summarized in details. Our results showcase that the field is slowly increasing in the past years, more specifically, since 2019.
