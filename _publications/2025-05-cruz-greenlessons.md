abstract: |-
  Technology brings exciting opportunities to improve our interactions with the natural surroundings. However, that same technological development might also negatively impact the environment. Every new technology has a carbon footprint, whether from its construction or operation. And most technological developments require software systems, and more recently AI-based software systems. For these software systems to positively impact our environment, they need to be developed and operated with sustainability in mind, also called 'green' in the software engineering discipline. In this chapter, we reflect on lessons learned from research and practice on green software and green AI, and discuss how sustainability principles can be incorporated into software development practices.
