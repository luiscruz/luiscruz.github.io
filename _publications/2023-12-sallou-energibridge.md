  In the continually evolving realm of software engineering, the need to address software energy consumption has gained increasing prominence. However, the absence of a platform-independent tool that facilitates straightforward energy measurements remains a notable gap. This paper presents EnergiBridge, a cross-platform measurement utility that provides support for Linux, Windows, and MacOS, as well as Intel, AMD, and Apple ARM CPU architectures. In essence, EnergiBridge serves as a bridge between energy-conscious software engineering and the diverse software environments in which it operates. It encourages a broader community to make informed decisions, minimize energy consumption, and reduce the environmental impact of software systems. By simplifying software energy measurements, EnergiBridge offers a valuable resource to make green software development more lightweight, education more inclusive, and research more reproducible. Through the evaluation, we highlight EnergiBridge's ability to gather energy data across diverse platforms and hardware configurations.
