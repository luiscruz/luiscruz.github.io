abstract: "Humanoid robots usually have a large number of degrees of freedom which turns humanoid control into a very complex problem. Humanoids are used in several RoboCup soccer leagues. In this work, the SimSpark simulator of the Simulation 3D will be used. This paper presents an automatic approach for developing humanoid behaviors based on the development of a generic optimization system. The paper describes the adopted architecture, main design choices and the results achieved with the optimization of a side kick and a forward kick. For both skills, the optimization approach allowed the creation of faster and more powerful and stable behaviors."
