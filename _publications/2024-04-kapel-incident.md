abstract: |-
  An incident management process is necessary in businesses that depend strongly on software and services. A proper process is essential to guarantee that incidents are well-handled, especially in a financial software-defined business needing to adhere to guidelines and regulations. This paper aims to enhance understanding of the current state of practice through a single-case exploratory case study, at the international bank ING, by interviewing 15 subject matter experts on the incident management process. The research identifies eight core observations on tool usage, the challenges experienced and future opportunities. Core challenges include monitoring data quality, the complexity of the environment, and the balance between minimising incident resolution time and following procedural guidelines.
