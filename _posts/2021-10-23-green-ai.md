AI is growiing bigger.

<span class="first-letter">S</span>ince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI training has been **doubling every 3.4 months** [@amodey2018ai].
It comes as no surprise that the state-of-the-art natural language processing model GPT-3 is estimated to require approximately 190,000 kWh to be trained[^gpt3]. This is equivalent to driving a car for 700,000 Km. Moreover, the total footprint is much higher when we sum the multiple iterations that were required to derive the final model.

The sustainability is a growing concern.
Show some numbers of state-of-the-art models.

Not everything is bad. AI-based solutions
are being created to address numerous sustainability issues[^ai-farm] – enabling decarbonisation of energy networks, precision farming [@finger2019precision], circular economies, combating the loss of biodiversity, creating precise climate models of our planet&nbsp;[@bauer2021digital], efficiently managing cooling systems (e.g., in data centres&nbsp;[@gao2014machine]), and so on.

However, despite the enormous potential of AI in making our planet more sustainable, the carbon footprint of AI models is far from being environmental friendly.


Squeezing the accuracy.
The new cliché about AI - Shift to data-centric AI

The increasing numbers of carbon emissions are worrisome but should not stay in the way of breakthrough advancements in this field. It rather should be a concern that grows side by side, enabling a sustainable and responsible scientific progress.

Hence, Green AI.

What is Green AI.

One could argue that the widely benefits of AI in our society make up for its environmental costs and that, consequently, addressing Green AI will mostly slow it down. But, in fact, it is quite the opposite:
Green AI is quintessential to enable advancements in AI while, at the same time, reach climate neutrality and high environmental standards.

Yet, all these strategies still assume carbon emissions. For example, data centres that rely on renewable energy sources still need a *marginal power plant* that runs on fossil fuels[^carbon-intensity]. Hence, reducing electricity needs is quintessential to reach carbon neutrality: we need energy-efficient AI technologies.


What should be done that has not yet been done.

Finally we should democratise Green AI. (AI is not democratic, the bar is quite high. Green AI makes the bar even higher. We have the moral responsibility to make Green AI inclusive and accessible to anyone (not only tech giants)
